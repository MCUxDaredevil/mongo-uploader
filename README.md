# Mongo Uploader

A basic python program to interact with MongoDB. 
It provides an interface to convert data between MongoDB and csv/Excel files

You can easily upload your csv/Excel files to MongoDB for Object-Oriented Storage or download Objects from MongoDB locally in the form of csv or Execl files.

I will add further support for other types if it crosses my mind or someone suggests it :)

- These are mainly for MongoDB connection. I will add them later

## Roadmap

- Update Environments section of README
- Create cli to take individual inputs if no args given in command
- Add a feature to have a .save file to load default args
- Think of more uses

I try to follow [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines for my code style and would like you to do the same.
If you find that I'm not following it or maybe have some better suggestions, feel free to let me know.

I would appreciate it if you can make any improvements to this or give any ideas for the same. You can create an issue for any bugs or suggestions.
