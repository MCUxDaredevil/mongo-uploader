# Mongo Uploader

A basic python program to interact with MongoDB. 
It provides an interface to convert data between MongoDB and csv/Excel files

You can easily upload your csv/Excel files to MongoDB for Object-Oriented Storage or download Objects from MongoDB locally in the form of csv or Execl files.

I will add further support for other types if it crosses my mind or someone suggests it :)
